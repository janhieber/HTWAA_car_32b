This Project includes:
- Programming projects
  - STM32CubeMX projects
  - MATLAB Simulink (2014a/b) projects
  - KEIL MDK-ARM 5 projects (containing the code generated by STM32CubeMX and Simulink)
- Howto for using Eclipse
- SPI example script for Raspberry Pi (for Test_SPI project)

# Why
This is a student project of the university HS Aalen in Germany.
